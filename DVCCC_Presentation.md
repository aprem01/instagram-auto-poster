# THE STORY

**Picture this moment:**

It's 2 AM. A woman in West Chester is lying awake, her children asleep in the next room. She's been thinking about leaving for months. Tonight, she finally opens Instagram on her phone - searching quietly, secretly, for help.

**What does she find?**

If DVCCC has a consistent, compassionate social media presence, she might find YOUR post. A message that says: *"You are not alone. Help is FREE. Help is CONFIDENTIAL. Help is HERE in Chester County."*

That post could change her life. It could save her life.

**But creating that content consistently? That's hard.**

Your team is busy saving lives - not writing Instagram captions. That's why I built this tool.

# WHAT I BUILT FOR DVCCC

A custom AI-powered content system designed **specifically** for the Domestic Violence Center of Chester County.

## THE MAGIC: 60 Seconds to Professional Content

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 30-60 min to write a caption | 30 seconds |
| Hunt for stock photos | AI creates unique images |
| Another 15 min for Spanish | One-click translation |
| Miss awareness dates | Automatic calendar alerts |
| **Total: 1+ hour per post** | **Total: 2 minutes** |

# LIVE DEMO SCRIPT

## DEMO 1: Create a Post (90 seconds)

**Say:** *"Let me show you how fast this is."*

1. Open the app
2. Type theme: **"You are not alone"**
3. Click **Generate**

**While it loads, say:**
*"The AI is doing three things right now: writing a caption in DVCCC's voice, creating hashtags, and generating a unique image - not a stock photo."*

**Show the result:**

## DEMO 2: Spanish Translation (30 seconds)

**Say:** *"Chester County has a significant Spanish-speaking population. With one click..."*

1. Click the **ES** language toggle

## DEMO 3: Awareness Calendar (30 seconds)

**Say:** *"The system knows your calendar better than you do."*

1. Show the awareness days panel

**Point out:**

# WHY THIS MATTERS

## Every Post Could Save a Life

A survivor searching at 2 AM might find your post.
A teenager looking for help might see your message.
A family member might share it with someone who needs it.

## Consistency = Visibility

Instagram's algorithm rewards consistent posting.
More visibility = more survivors finding DVCCC.
More reach = more lives changed.

## Spanish-Speaking Survivors

10% of Chester County speaks Spanish at home.
Your message needs to reach them too.
#NoEstasSola means "You are not alone" in their language.
